Install Node.js:

Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
Download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version suitable for your operating system.
Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js.
Create a project folder:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project folder.
Create a new folder using the command: mkdir project-name.
Move into the project folder using the command: cd project-name.
Initialize a new Node.js project:

Inside the project folder, run the command: npm init -y.
This will initialize a new Node.js project with default settings.
Install Puppeteer:

In the terminal, run the command: npm install puppeteer.
Create the script file:

Use a text editor to create a new file inside the project folder, e.g., generateWallets.js.
Copy and paste the code into the generateWallets.js file.
Run the script:

In the terminal, navigate to the project folder if you're not already in it.
Run the command: node generateWallets.js.
The script will launch a headless browser, generate wallets, and save the details to a file named wallets.txt.
Check the output:

After the script finishes running, check the project folder for the wallets.txt file.
Open the wallets.txt file to view the generated wallet details.
That's it! You've successfully run the code. Feel free to modify the script or explore other functionalities as you continue working with Node.js and Puppeteer.
